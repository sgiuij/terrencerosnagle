<p>I offer professional transcription service for guitar.</p>

<p>How does it work?  Ever hear a song you want to learn but don't have the patience or time to figure it out?  I'll do it for you.  I can do parts of songs (solos, intros, bridges, etc) or complete songs.   Perhaps you have the sheet music for a song or piece, but don't read standard notation - I can put it into guitar tab to your specifications.</p>

<p>Prices-
$30.00 per hour.  Most songs take about an hour.  Parts of songs require less time so prices are adjusted accordingly.</p>

 <p>Simply contact me at mail@terrencerosnagle.com   Let me know the music you would like transcribed.  I will quote you a price and turn-around time.  Once the transcription is made I will tell you. Then, you pay and  I give you the transcription.</p>
